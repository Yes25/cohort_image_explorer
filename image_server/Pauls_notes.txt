Mapping:

	- mpiId: //PID/PID.3/CX.2 -> Over MPI request
	- compositionId: null
	- encounterId: //PV1/PV1.19
	- statusCode:
		○ Dependent on received messages
		○ A14 -> Pending admit -> ignore
		○ A01/A05 -> Actual admit -> "in-progress"
		○ A03 -> Discharge -> "finished"
	- periodStart:
		○ On and after admit: //PV1/PV1.44/TS.1
			§ Could be updated by new messages
	- periodEnd:
		○ On and after discharge: //PV1/PV1.45/TS.1
			§ Could be updated by new messages
	- deceased: //PID/PID.30
		○ Y/N
	- dateOfDeath: //PID/PID.29/TS.1
		○ Empty if alive
	- discharge_type: Used in job to indicate patient vital status after discharge (i.e. is dead or alive)
		○ Use dod

Location Mapping:

Procedure:
Find all unique movements (indicted by ID in //ZBE/ZBE.1) and select most recent update. Filter movements that feature the DELETE action code in their last update.
Build location chain in order of movement timestamps and add end timestamps to a location stay if there is a movement with a start timestamp later than is own.

	- periodStart: //ZBE/ZBE.2
	- periodEnd:
		○ Determined by subsequent movements start timestamp (see periodStart)
		○ Open for discharge movements
	- status:
		○ Completed if both dates are set
		○ Active if only periodStart is set
	- ward: //PV1/PV1.3/PL.1
	- Department: //PV1/PV1.3/PL.4
	- encounter_type: Why have it here?
